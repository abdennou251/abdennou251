👤 Who am I?
Hey there! I’m a 21-year-old student currently studying at 1337, an institution that belongs to the 42 network. I'm deeply passionate about exploring the realms of high-level problem solving, diving into new programming languages, and understanding low-level concepts that power modern software systems.

The 42 network is famous for its innovative approach to learning, where there are no traditional professors, just a community-driven curriculum and a rigorous set of challenges. It’s been a wild ride, and I’m loving every minute of it!

💡 My Interests
High-Level Problem Solving: I’m constantly looking for ways to solve complex problems with elegant and efficient solutions. Whether it's algorithmic challenges, real-world engineering problems, or mathematical puzzles, I’m all in.

Programming Languages: I have a strong interest in picking up new programming languages. Whether it's exploring popular ones like Python or C++ or diving into something more niche, I love learning how different languages approach problem solving.

Low-Level Learning: I’m also passionate about low-level systems programming. Understanding how the machine works under the hood—memory management, assembly, and operating system internals—fascinates me. I believe that understanding the basics gives me the power to solve higher-level problems more effectively.

🛠️ Technical Skills
Languages: C, Python, Bash, Assembly, JavaScript, C++
Tools: Git, Docker, Vim, various IDEs
Concepts: Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Networking, Computer Architecture
🚀 What I’m Looking to Achieve
I’m always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to deepen my knowledge in both high-level and low-level computing. Whether that’s through personal projects, collaborating with others, or diving into new research, I aim to push the boundaries of my knowledge and skill set.

🌱 Current Goals
Continue mastering problem-solving skills and tackling increasingly complex challenges.
Deepen my understanding of low-level programming and systems architecture.
Stay up-to-date with emerging technologies and new programming languages.
Contribute to open-source projects and engage in collaborative learning.
